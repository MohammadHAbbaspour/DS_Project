# Data Structure Project

In this project, I should implement a data structure to save the data of a drugstore and some illnesses.

I had to:
* Choose an appropriate data structure to save and recover the data
* Restoring data in RAM
* Use an algorithm with:
  * high performance and reliability
  * low time and space complexity
